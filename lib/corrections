You are my senior full-stack engineer. Your ONLY job is to:

1. Fix and enforce the bookmarking system behavior.
2. Fix the login modal behavior (including guest login and dummy login).
3. Ensure all audio samples and Read/Listen buttons work for each book.

You must NOT change anything else.

===============================================
🔒 HARD LIMITS — DO NOT BREAK THESE
===============================================
- Do NOT modify UI, layout, styling, animations, spacing, colors, or general appearance.
- Do NOT refactor or rewrite large sections of code.
- Do NOT reorganize folders, rename files, or change the project structure.
- Do NOT add new features I did NOT ask for.
- Do NOT change dynamic routing (it already works).
- Do NOT change any logic unrelated to:
  • bookmarking,
  • Library behavior,
  • login modal (including guest & dummy login),
  • audio playback for book samples,
  • Read / Listen buttons for each book.

ONLY touch the minimum number of lines necessary to satisfy the requirements below.

===============================================
📚 SECTION 1 — BOOKMARKING & LIBRARY
===============================================
Make sure the bookmarking system works exactly as described:

1. When a user clicks the bookmark button on any book:
   - The bookmark state must toggle correctly (bookmarked ↔ unbookmarked).
   - When a book is bookmarked, it must automatically be saved to the user's Library using whatever persistence system already exists (localStorage, database, API, etc.).
   - The same book must NOT be added multiple times — prevent duplicates in the Library.
   - Bookmark state and Library contents must persist after page refresh.

2. On the Library page:
   - All saved books must display correctly from persistent storage.
   - Bookmarks should still behave correctly when toggled on/off from here (if supported in the current design), without breaking anything.

3. Do NOT change:
   - Any existing styling or layout for book cards.
   - Any routing logic (clicking books to open details already works — leave that intact).

===============================================
🪟 SECTION 2 — LOGIN MODAL BEHAVIOR (ALL PAGES)
===============================================
Fix the login modal behavior across ALL pages where it appears.

1. Library page — Login as Guest:
   - When the user clicks the **“Login as Guest”** button:
     • The login modal must immediately close (hide/remove).
     • The user should be treated as “logged in” for accessing the Library (no real auth needed).
     • The modal must NOT reopen automatically unless explicitly triggered again.

2. Regular login with dummy data:
   - When the user (or my instructor) enters ANY dummy data (fake email + password) and submits:
     • The login modal must immediately close after submission.
     • No real auth or validation is required — treat any input as a successful login for now.
     • The modal should stay closed unless the user purposefully opens it.

3. Modal consistency on all pages:
   - Ensure the modal’s close behavior is consistent for:
     • clicking the close/X button (if present),
     • clicking outside the modal (if supported),
     • clicking “Login as Guest”,
     • submitting the login form with any data.
   - Fix the issue with the modal on **every page** where it appears so it never gets stuck, half-visible, or reappears unexpectedly.

===============================================
🎧 SECTION 3 — AUDIO SAMPLES & READ/LISTEN BUTTONS
===============================================
Make sure audio and buttons work correctly for each book, on EVERY page where the books appear.

1. Audio recording samples:
   - For each book that has an audio sample:
     • Make sure it is wired to the correct audio source.
     • Ensure the audio is actually playable (not muted, not broken).
   - On every page where that book appears (home, Library, lists, detail, etc.):
     • The user must be able to listen to the sample via the proper control.
   - If there is already an audio player component, reuse it instead of creating a new one.

2. Read & Listen buttons:
   - For each book card or book display:
     • The **Read** button under the book must perform its intended action (e.g., navigate to the book’s reader/detail page, or whatever is already designed).
     • The **Listen** button(s) under the Read button must:
       – trigger audio playback for that specific book’s sample,
       – not trigger the wrong book’s audio.
   - This must work consistently:
     • on the homepage (if books are shown there),
     • on the Library page,
     • on search/category/all-books pages (if present),
     • on the individual book detail page (if applicable).

===============================================
🧪 SECTION 4 — SELF-TESTING REQUIREMENTS
===============================================
Before you give me any final code, you MUST internally test or reason through the code and ensure that all of the following are true:

1. Bookmarking:
   - Clicking the bookmark button:
     • toggles bookmarked/unbookmarked correctly,
     • automatically saves the book to the Library when bookmarked,
     • prevents duplicates in the Library,
     • persists after refresh.
   - The Library loads all saved books correctly.

2. Login modal:
   - On the Library page:
     • Clicking “Login as Guest” closes the modal immediately and allows Library access.
   - On any page with the login form:
     • Submitting ANY email/password closes the modal.
   - The modal opens and closes consistently via its triggers with no stuck or ghost states.

3. Audio + Read/Listen:
   - All existing audio samples are audible on each page where their book appears.
   - All **Read** buttons work as intended for each book.
   - All **Listen** buttons work for each book and play the correct audio.

4. No regressions:
   - Bookmarking still works correctly everywhere it is used.
   - Dynamic routing to book pages still works exactly as before.
   - No unrelated UI, styling, or behavior has changed.
   - No new errors are introduced in the console.

===============================================
📤 SECTION 5 — OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
===============================================
When you respond:

- Only modify files that are directly related to:
  • bookmarking & Library persistence,
  • login modal & login/guest logic,
  • audio samples & Read/Listen button behavior.
- Do NOT alter unrelated files, components, or configuration.

- Provide:
  • Full updated code blocks for every file you changed (so I can copy/paste directly).
  • A short explanation listing:
    – which files were changed,
    – what was changed,
    – why each change was necessary to satisfy the requirements.

- Do NOT include:
  • Unsolicited refactors,
  • Extra “improvements”,
  • Changes to styling or layout,
  • New features not requested.

===============================================
❓ QUESTIONS
===============================================
If you absolutely need more info (for example, to know where the current login modal or bookmark logic lives), ask me ONE very specific question at a time.
Otherwise, proceed with the changes using the existing project structure and patterns.
